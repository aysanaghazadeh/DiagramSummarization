Chloroplast consists of outer membrane, granum, lumen, thylakoids, stroma, inner membrane. The outer membrane of the chloroplast envelope, like that of mitochondria, contains porins and is therefore freely permeable to small molecules.Chloroplasts circulate within plant cells. .. In most higher plants, the thylakoids are arranged in tight stacks called grana (singular granum).Unlike mitochondria, chloroplasts have three phospholipid bilayers. ... Each chloroplast contains many, many grana. The space between the inner chloroplast membrane and the grana is called the stroma. The space inside the thylakoid discs is called the lumen, or, more specifically, the thylakoid lumen.The outer membrane is permeable to small organic molecules, whereas the inner membrane is less permeable and studded with transport proteins. The innermost matrix of chloroplasts, called the stroma, contains metabolic enzymes and multiple copies of the chloroplast genome.The outer membrane is permeable to small organic molecules, whereas the inner membrane is less permeable and studded with transport proteins. The innermost matrix of chloroplasts, called the stroma, contains metabolic enzymes and multiple copies of the chloroplast genome. The Structure and Function of Chloroplasts In addition to the inner and outer membranes of the envelope, chloroplasts have a third internal membrane system, called the thylakoid membrane.What is the relationship of chloroplast? Chloroplasts absorb sunlight and use it in conjunction with water and carbon dioxide gas to produce food for the plant. Chloroplasts capture light energy from the sun to produce the free energy stored in ATP and NADPH through a process called photosynthesis.Inside the chloroplast are stacks of thylakoids, called grana, as well as stroma, the dense fluid inside of the chloroplast. These thylakoids contain the chlorophyll that is necessary for the plant to go through."

During a warm summer -- optimal conditions for a housefly -- the cycle, from fertilized egg to adult, spans a mere seven to 10 days.After a male housefly chases down and fertilizes a female counterpart, she's ready to lay her eggs. Houseflies are solitary creatures. Like the rest of the insect world, males and females do not stick together after mating and, unlike nesting insects, females do not care for or protect eggs. Females simply leave the eggs where they will be safe from predators and have plenty to eat upon hatching.The female housefly deposits her eggs in the crevices and corners of the same kinds of decaying organic matter adults feed on. Within a day, the first larvae begin to emerge from the eggs. Also known as maggots, these worm-like creatures are little more than fleshy, sectionless tubes with hooked mouth parts used for feeding.The maggots grow rapidly. In less than two days they've doubled in size and therefore must molt. Molting is a process common to many invertebrates through which a growing insect sheds its former exoskeleton and grows a new one. A maggot will molt twice more, emerging larger and more developed each time."

Wasps are distinguished from the ants and bees of Apocrita by various behavioral and physical characteristics, particularly their possession of a slender, smooth body and legs with relatively few hairs. Wasps also generally are predatory or parasitic and have stingers with few barbs that can be removed easily from their victims. Similar to other members of Apocrita, wasps have a narrow petiole, or “waist,” which attaches the abdomen to the thorax.  Wasps have biting mouthparts and antennae with 12 or 13 segments. They are normally winged. In stinging species, only the females are provided with a formidable sting, which involves use of a modified ovipositor (egg-laying structure) for piercing and venom-producing glands. Adult wasps may feed on nectar and, in some species, on the secretions produced by larvae. Larvae of predatory wasp species typically feed on insects, while larvae of parasitic species feed on their hosts."

However, very broadly speaking, we can say that most sharks live for between 20 and 40 years. The Spiny Dogfish lives for over a century, and Whale Sharks are expected to be similar. Unlike most other animals, sharks generally do not care for their young. As soon as pups are born into the water, they swim away and care for themselves. Some sharks give birth to litters of up to 100 babies at a time, while others may have as few as two or three. The Great White Shark gives birth to approximately three to 14 pups at a time. In almost all cases, all of the pups are beable and well-developed. This is in stark contrast to many other animals (such as several fish species and some turtles), which give birth to large numbers of ill-developed young"

The first meal for most caterpillars is the eggshell. The picture on the left shows a Black Swallowtail caterpillar getting ready to pupate or form a chrysalis. It has made a silk mat and attached itself at the base. When a butterfly emerges from a chrysalis its wings are crumpled. The butterfly will hang with its wings down and will begin pumping the wings full of fluids from their body to straighten them out."

Regardless of what you call them, these beetles belong to the family Coccinellidae. All ladybugs progress through a four-stage life cycle known as complete metamorphosis The ladybug life cycle begins with an egg. Once she has mated, the female ladybug lays a cluster of five to 30 eggs.1﻿ She usually deposits her eggs on a plant with suitable prey for her offspring to eat when they hatch; aphids are a favorite food. In a three-month period that commences in spring or early summer, a single female ladybug can produce more than 1,000 eggs.2  ﻿   Scientists believe ladybugs lay both fertile and infertile eggs in the cluster. When aphids are in limited supply, the newly hatched larvae will feed on the infertile eggs.In two to 10 days, ladybug larvae emerge from their eggs.3﻿ Species and environmental variables such as temperature can shorten or lengthen this timeframe. Ladybug larvae look somewhat like tiny alligators, with elongated bodies and bumpy exoskeletons. In many species, the ladybug larvae are black with brightly colored spots or bands.   In the larval stage, ladybugs feed voraciously. In the two weeks it takes to become fully grown, a single larva can consume 350 to 400 aphids.4﻿ Larvae feed on other soft-bodied plant pests as well, including scale insects, adelgids, mites, and insect eggs. Ladybug larvae don't discriminate when feeding and will sometimes eat ladybug eggs, too.In its pupal stage, the ladybug is usually yellow or orange with black markings. The pupa remains still, attached to a leaf, throughout this stage. The ladybug's body undergoes a remarkable transformation, directed by special cells called histoblasts. They control a biochemical process through which the larval body is broken down and reformed into the adult ladybug Newly emerged adults, or imagos, have soft exoskeletons, making them vulnerable to predators until their cuticles harden. They appear pale and yellow when they emerge but soon develop the deep, bright colors for which ladybugs are known.  Adult ladybugs feed on soft-bodied insects, just as their larvae do. Adults overwinter, usually hibernating in aggregations. They mate soon after becoming active again in the spring"

In this process, water moves from one reservoir to another by processes such as evaporation, sublimation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, surface runoff and infiltration, during which water converts itself to various forms like liquid, solid and vapour. Evaporation: Evaporation is a type of vaporization, where liquid is converted to gas before reaching its boiling point. Water evaporates from the surface of the earth and water bodies such as the oceans, seas, lakes, ponds and rivers. Sublimation: Sublimation is conversion of solid to gas, without passing through the intermediate liquid phase. Ice sheets and ice caps from north and south poles, and icecaps on mountains, get converted into water vapour directly, without converting into liquid. Transpiration: Transpiration is the process by which plants release water vapour into the atmosphere through stomata in leaves and stems. Condensation: Condensation is the changing of gas phase into liquid phase and is the reverse of vaporisation. At higher altitudes, the temperature is low. The water vapour present there condenses to form very tiny particles of water droplets. These particles come close together to form clouds and fog. Precipitation: Due to change in wind or temperature, clouds combine to make bigger droplets, and pour down as precipitation(rain). Precipitation includes drizzle, rain, snow and hail. Run off : As the water pours down, it runs over the surface of earth. Runoff water combines to form channels, rivers, lakes and ends up into seas and oceans. Infiltration: Some of the precipitated water moves deep into the soil. Then it moves down and increases the ground water level. Percolation: Some of the precipitated water flows through soil and porous or fractured rock. Infiltration and percolation are two related but different processes describing the movement of water through soil."

In the United States, sandfly may refer to certain horse flies that are also known as ""greenheads"" (family Tabanidae), or to members of the family Ceratopogonidae. Outside the United States, sandfly may refer to members of the subfamily Phlebotominae within the Psychodidae. Biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) are sometimes called sandflies or no-see-ums (no-see-em, noseeum). New Zealand sandflies are in the genus Austrosimulium, a type of black fly.A black fly or blackfly[1] (sometimes called a buffalo gnat, turkey gnat, or white socks) is any member of the family Simuliidae of the Culicomorpha infraorder. They are related to the Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae, and Thaumaleidae. Over 2,200 species of black flies have been formally named, of which 15 are extinct.[2] They are divided into two subfamilies: Parasimuliinae contains only one genus and four species; Simuliinae contains all the rest. Over 1,800 of the species belong to the genus Simulium.Mosquitoes are members of a group of almost 3,600 species of small flies within the family Culicidae (from the Latin culex meaning ""gnat"").[1] The word ""mosquito"" (formed by mosca and diminutive -ito)[2] is Spanish and Portuguese for ""little fly"".[3][4] Mosquitoes have a slender segmented body, one pair of wings, one pair of halteres, three pairs of long hair-like legs, and elongated mouthparts.The sand flies feed on plants and the ingested tissues may contain cellulose particles that the sand flies are unable to digest. Cellulolytic enzymes are secreted by L. major promastigotes and this may help to break down cellulose in infected flies and sustain their growth.Sand flies typically bite at dawn and dusk, and they are known to attack people in swarms. They prefer to bite the face, hands and scalp. Mosquito bites become a raised, red, itching bump, while sand fly bites are very small and painful and appear in clusters. They can cause rashes and fevers."

It is believed to have evolved in the Cenozoic Era, possibly in the Middle East, and has spread all over the world as a commensal of humans. It is the most common fly species found in houses. Adults are gray to black, with four dark, longitudinal lines on the thorax, slightly hairy bodies, and a single pair of membranous wings. They have red eyes, set farther apart in the slightly larger female.  The female housefly usually mates only once and stores the sperm for later use. She lays batches of about 100 eggs on decaying organic matter such as food waste, carrion, or feces. These soon hatch into legless white larvae, known as maggots. After two to five days of development, these metamorphose into reddish-brown pupae, about 8 millimetres (3⁄8 inch) long. Adult flies normally live for two to four weeks, but can hibernate during the winter. The adults feed on a variety of liquid or semi-liquid substances, as well as solid materials which have been softened by their saliva. They can carry pathogens on their bodies and in their feces, contaminate food, and contribute to the transfer of food-borne illnesses, while, in numbers, they can be physically annoying. For these reasons, they are considered pests.  Houseflies have been used in the laboratory in research into aging and sex determination. Houseflies appear in literature from Ancient Greek myth and Aesop's The Impertinent Insect onwards. Authors sometimes choose the housefly to speak of the brevity of life, as in William Blake's 1794 poem ""The Fly"", which deals with mortality subject to uncontrollable circumstances."

It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. 'Waxing' means the Moon's illumination is growing, and 'Crescent' means less than half of the Moon is illuminated. This moon phase signifies intention The Moon does not emit its own light, shining instead by reflecting sunlight. The waxing (growing) crescent Moon rises before noon, transits the meridian before sunset and sets before midnight. .. The waxing crescent phase repeats every 29.531 days – one synodic month. First Quarter Moon is the second primary Moon phase and it is defined as the moment the Moon has reached the first quarter of its orbit around Earth, hence the name. It is also called Half Moon as we can see exactly 50% of the Moon's surface illuminated. A waxing gibbous moon is in the sky when darkness falls. It lights up the early evening. It appears more than half lighted, but less than full. A waxing gibbous moon comes between first quarter moon and full moon. The Full Moon is when the Sun and the Moon are aligned on opposite sides of Earth, and 100% of the Moon's face is illuminated by the Sun (see illustration). That said, some Full Moons are only 99.9% illuminated, as seen from Earth. .. Full Moon is when the Sun and the Moon are aligned on opposite sides of Earth During the Waning Crescent Moon phase, the lit-up part of the Moon decreases from 49.9% to 0.1%. .. Waning means that it's shrinking and getting smaller, while crescent refers to the curved sickle shape. The Moon's surface reflects the Sun's rays, and half of it is always illuminated by sunlight.Waning Crescent: In the Northern Hemisphere, we see the waning crescent phase as a thin crescent of light on the left. The Moon displays these eight phases one after the other as it moves through its cycle each month. It takes 27 days for the Moon to orbit Earth. That means the Moon's cycle is 27 days long."

The male parts are called stamens and usually surround the pistil. The stamen is made up of two parts: the anther and filament. The anther produces pollen (male reproductive cells). The filament holds the anther up Petals are also important parts of the flower, because they help attract pollinators such as bees, butterflies and bats.

Adult dragonflies are charactestrongrized by large, multifaceted eyes, two pairs of , transparent wings, sometimes with coloured patches, and an elongated body. Dragonflies can be mistaken for the related group, damselflies (Zygoptera), which are similar in structure, though usually lighter in build; however, the wings of most dragonflies are held flat and away from the body, while damselflies hold their wings folded at rest, along or above the abdomen. Dragonflies are agile fliers, while damselflies have a weaker, fluttery flight. Many dragonflies have brilliant iridescent or metallic colour million years produced by structural colouration, making them conspicuous in flight. An adult dragonfly's compound eyes have nearly 24,000 ommatidia each.  Fossils of very large dragonfly-like insects, sometimes called griffinflies, are found from 325s ago (Mya) in Upper Carboniferous rocks; these had wingspans up to about 750 mm (30 in), but were only distant ancestors, not true dragonflies. About 3,000 extant species of true dragonfly are known. Most are tropical, with fewer species in temperate regions. Loss of wetland habitat threatens dragonfly populations around the world.  Dragonflies are predators, both in their aquatic nymphs stage (also known as naiads) and as adults. In some species, the nymphal stage lasts for up to five years, and the adult stage may be as long as ten weeks, but most species have an adult lifespan in the order of five weeks or less, and some survive for only a few days.[2] They are fast, agile fliers, sometimes migrating across oceans, and often live near water. They have a uniquely complex mode of reproduction involving indirect insemination, delayed fertilization, and sperm competition. During mating, the male grasps the female at the back of the head, and the female curls her abdomen under her body to pick up sperm from the male's secondary genitalia at the front of his abdomen, forming the ""heart"" or ""wheel"" posture.  Dragonflies are represented in human culture on artefacts such as pottery, rock paintings, statues and Art Nouveau jewellery. They are used in traditional medicine in Japan and China, and caught for food in Indonesia. They are symbols of courage, strength, and happiness in Japan, but seen as sinister in European folklore. Their bright colours and agile flight are admired in the poetry of Lord Tennyson and the prose Dragonflies and their relatives are similar in structure to an ancient group, meganisoptera, from the 325 Mya Upper Carboniferous of Europe, a group that included the largest insect that ever lived, Meganeuropsis permiana from the Early Permian, with a wingspan around 750 mm (30 in);[4]. Known informally as ""griffinflies"", their fossil record ends with the Permian–Triassic extinction event (about 247 Mya). The Protanisoptera, another ancestral group that lacks certain wing vein characters found in modern Odonata, lived from the Early to Late Permian age until the end Permian event, and are known from fossil wings from current-day United States, Russia, and Australia, suggesting they might have been cosmopolitan in distribution. While both of those groups are sometimes referred to as ""giant dragonflies"", in fact true dragonflies/odonata are more modern insects that had not evolved yet.  Modern dragonflies do retain some traits of their distant predecessors, and are in a group known as palaeoptera, ancient-winged. They, like the gigantic pre-dinosaur griffinflies, lack the ability to fold their wings up against their bodies in the way modern insects do, although some evolved their own different way to do so. The forerunners of modern Odonata are included in a clade called the Panodonata, which include the basal Zygoptera (damselflies) and the Anisoptera (true dragonflies).[5] Today, some 3,000 species are extant around the world.[6][7]  The relationships of anisopteran families are not fully resolved as of 2013, but all the families are monophyletic except the Corduliidae; the Gomphidae are a sister taxon to all other Anisoptera, the Austropetaliidae are sister to the Aeshnoidea, and the Chlorogomphidae are sister to a clade that includes the Synthemistidae and Libellulidae.[8] On the cladogram, dashed lines indicate unresolved relationships; English names are given (in parentheses)"
